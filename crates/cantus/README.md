## Features

**Graphics**: Heavily GPU accelerated for high-performance, animated rendering of the music widget.

**Queue Display**: Displays your spotify queue in a visual timeline, shows upcoming songs as well as the history.

**Playback Controls**: Provides playback controls for play/pause, skip forward/backward by clicking to seek to a song, and volume adjustment with scroll. You can also smoothly drag the whole bar to seek through the timeline.

**Playlist Editing**: Favourite playlists to be displayed, shows when a song is contained in that playlist and allows you to add/remove songs from the playlist. (Also includes star ratings!)

## Usage

`cantus` currently runs as a native Wayland layer-shell application.

Spotify authentication opens in the browser on first launch; no developer API key is required.

## Installing with Nix
Available in nixpkgs.

As a flake for home manager:
Add to flake.nix inputs `cantus.url = "github:CodedNil/cantus";`
Enable it as a systemd module with home-manager:
```
imports = [ inputs.cantus.homeManagerModules.default ];
programs.cantus = {
  enable = true;
  package = pkgs.cantus;
};
```
